# Coffee Roast Log 

*Description:*
A coffee roasting log to input the details that involve roasting coffee beans like roast method, temperature, fan settings, time of first crack and other details. All these details matter if you want the same consistent roast/taste in your cup of coffee. There are many types of beans from different countries and you can roast them many different ways. Users need to log in to add roasts or review. Roasting coffee beans all started out as a way to save a little time and money. Me and a friend found a popcorn popper, bought some green beans and started roasting.
